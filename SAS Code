*Separating the results for males and females suggests that weight differs for males and females;
*There are an approximately equal number of males and females;

*Creating a side-by-side boxplot of weight for each level of sex;
*The results suggest that weight differs significantly for males and females;

*Conducting simple linear regressions with the dependent variable age for the independent variable weight, sorted by sex;
*Results of male and female have significant p-values;
*The residuals for females suggest the presence of one outlier. The histogram of residuals is not normally distributed, suggesting that the assumption of normality of error terms does not hold.;
*The residuals for males suggest the presence of two minor outliers. The histogram of residuals is not normally distributed, 
suggesting that the assumption of normality of error terms does not hold. The right end of the fit mean plot is taller than the left, suggesting there is unexplained variation in the model.;

*Testing to determine if the residuals are normally distributed;
*The Shapiro-Wilk test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,  Cramer-von Mises test, and Anderson-Darling test all have non-significant p-values for both sexes, suggesting that the residuals are not normally distributed;
